# Code Block Classification Project: Final Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the code block classification project, comparing our implementation with the research presented in the PeerJ Computer Science paper (peerj-cs-1230) titled "Code4ML: a large-scale dataset of annotated Machine Learning code."

## Project Overview

This project focuses on training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify code blocks into different categories based on their semantic type using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) features. The implementation uses a dataset of annotated code snippets to train a model that can automatically identify the semantic type of a given code block, which is an important step in understanding and organizing machine learning code.

## Dataset

Our implementation uses the `markup_data.csv` dataset, which contains annotated code snippets with the following columns:
- `code_block`: The Python code snippet to be classified
- `graph_vertex_id`: The label/category of the code block
- `too_long`: A flag indicating if the code block is too long for classification
- `marks`: A confidence score for the annotation
- `Unnamed: 0`: An index column

The dataset contains approximately 8,000 unique code snippets that have been manually annotated with semantic types according to a taxonomy tree.

## Comparison with PeerJ-CS-1230 Paper (Code4ML)

### Dataset Size and Composition

| Aspect | Our Implementation | PeerJ-CS-1230 Paper |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Dataset Size | ~8,000 unique code snippets | ~2.5 million code snippets |
| Source | Markup data | Kaggle notebooks |
| Annotation | Manual annotation with semantic types | Manual annotation with taxonomy tree |
| Languages | Python | Python |

The PeerJ-CS-1230 paper presents a much larger dataset called Code4ML, which contains approximately 2.5 million code snippets collected from about 100,000 Jupyter notebooks on Kaggle. Our implementation uses a smaller, more focused dataset of manually annotated code snippets.

### Taxonomy and Classification

Both approaches use a taxonomy to classify code snippets:

- **Our Implementation**: Uses a simple classification scheme with categories like class, function, variable, loop, and condition.
- **PeerJ-CS-1230**: Uses a more complex two-level taxonomy tree with 11 upper-level categories and approximately 80 lower-level classes.

The paper's taxonomy is more comprehensive, covering various aspects of the ML pipeline, including data loading, visualization, transformation, model training, and evaluation.

### Model Performance

| Metric | Our Implementation (Main.ipynb) | PeerJ-CS-1230 Paper |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| F1-Score | 0.679 | 0.684 (Linear SVM) to 0.872 (Semi-supervised) |
| Accuracy | 0.684 | 0.691 (Linear SVM) to 0.872 (Semi-supervised) |

Our implementation in Main.ipynb achieves an F1-score of 0.679 and an accuracy of 0.684 using a linear SVM with optimized hyperparameters. The paper reports higher performance metrics, especially when using semi-supervised learning approaches that leverage unlabeled data.

### Model Architecture

| Aspect | Our Implementation | PeerJ-CS-1230 Paper |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Model | Linear SVM | Linear SVM, Polynomial SVM, RBF SVM, Semi-supervised SVM |
| Vectorization | TF-IDF | TF-IDF |
| Hyperparameters | Optimized (C=4.47, min_df=2, max_df=0.48) | Optimized through cross-validation |
| Cross-validation | 10-fold | 10-fold |

Both approaches use SVM models with TF-IDF vectorization. Our implementation uses hyperparameter optimization through Optuna to find the best parameters for the SVM model, similar to the approach in the paper. However, the paper explores a wider range of SVM variants and uses more sophisticated semi-supervised learning techniques.

## Implementation Details

Our implementation consists of the following components:

1. **Data Preparation**: Reading the markup_data.csv file and selecting the required columns (code_block and graph_vertex_id).

2. **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converting the code blocks into numerical features using TF-IDF with optimized parameters (min_df=2, max_df=0.48).

3. **Model Training**: Training an SVM model with a linear kernel using optimized hyperparameters (C=4.47).

4. **Cross-Validation**: Evaluating the model using 10-fold cross-validation.

5. **Model Saving**: Saving the trained model and TF-IDF vectorizer for later use.

The implementation is orchestrated through a Jupyter notebook (`Main.ipynb`) that handles the data preparation, model training, and evaluation.

## Results and Performance

Our SVM model achieved the following performance metrics:

- **F1-Score**: 0.679 (±0.015)
- **Accuracy**: 0.684 (±0.016)

These results are comparable to the basic Linear SVM model reported in the PeerJ-CS-1230 paper (F1-score: 0.684, Accuracy: 0.691), but lower than their semi-supervised approach which achieved an F1-score of 0.872.

The difference in performance can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Dataset Size**: The paper uses a much larger dataset, which can lead to better generalization.

2. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: The paper leverages unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning, which significantly improves performance.

3. **Model Complexity**: The paper explores more complex SVM variants and hyperparameter optimization.

## Key Findings from the Comparison

1. **Effectiveness of Semi-Supervised Learning**: The paper demonstrates that using pseudo-labels on unlabeled data can significantly improve model performance, increasing the F1-score from 0.684 (Linear SVM) to 0.872 (Semi-supervised SVM).

2. **Importance of Dataset Size**: The larger dataset in the paper (2.5 million snippets vs. our 8,000) likely contributes to better model generalization.

3. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Both implementations benefit from careful hyperparameter tuning, with our implementation achieving optimal results with C=4.47, min_df=2, and max_df=0.48.

4. **Taxonomy Complexity**: The paper's more detailed taxonomy (11 upper-level categories and 80 lower-level classes) provides a more nuanced classification of code snippets compared to our simpler approach.

## Conclusion

Our implementation provides a solid foundation for code block classification using SVM and TF-IDF features. While our performance metrics are slightly lower than those reported in the PeerJ-CS-1230 paper, our approach is more accessible and requires less computational resources.

The PeerJ-CS-1230 paper demonstrates the potential of more advanced approaches, particularly semi-supervised learning, which achieved an F1-score of 0.872 compared to our 0.679.

## Future Work

Based on the comparison with the PeerJ-CS-1230 paper, future work could focus on:

1. **Expanding the Dataset**: Collecting more code snippets from diverse sources.

2. **Implementing Semi-Supervised Learning**: Leveraging unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning approaches.

3. **Exploring More Complex Models**: Investigating different SVM kernels and other machine learning approaches.

4. **Refining the Taxonomy**: Developing a more comprehensive taxonomy for code classification.

By addressing these areas, we can build on our current implementation and work towards the performance levels demonstrated in the PeerJ-CS-1230 paper.
